# About
Typos is a web app designed to help users test, practice, and improve their writing speeds and accuracies. Users can generate a list of random words, type those words in the given input box, and see their speed and accuracy after completing the list.

This web app primarily uses React.js along with TypeScript. 

# Usage
There are two ways of accessing the app: you can either view the public website [here](typos-drewdalmedo.web.app), or spin up a local development server.

To spin up a development server, follow the below steps:

```
